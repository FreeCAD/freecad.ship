## FreeCAD Ship Workbench

**Welcome to FreeCAD-Ship!**

FreeCAD-Ship is a free module for [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org) oriented to aid naval ship design by providing several tools commonly used in naval architecture, seakeeping and ship resistance.

It currently offers the following tools:

### Outline drawing

*Since FreeCAD already provides tools to carry out this task, this tool will be removed in a close future.*

### Areas curve

This tool computes the area of each transversal section of the ship, plotting it and providing a spreadsheet with the very same results. The transversal areas curve offers really valuable information in the first stages of a ship's design, as it gives an idea of the shape and volume distribution of the ship.

### Hydrostatics

The most common hydrostatics can be easily computed with this tool. The hydrostatics are divided in 3 main groups:

 - Volume
   - Wetted area (WSA), heavily related with the ship dynamics.
   - Moment to trim the ship 1 cm (MTC), of critical relevance at the time of planning load conditions.
   - Longitudinal position of the bouyance center (XCB).
 - Stability
   - Floating Area/Waterplane Area (WP), related with the ship waves generation, and thus with the ship resistance.
   - Distance between the keel and bouyance center (KBt), which is related with the transversal stability.
   - Distance between the bouyance center and the metacenter (BMt), which is related with the transversal stability.
 - Coefficients
   - Block coefficient (Cb), heavily related with the ship resistance.
   - Floating Coefficient (Cf), heavily related with the ship resistance due to the waves generation.
   - Main section Coefficient (Cm), related with the ship transversal stability, as well as the ship dynamics.

On top of that, the Displacement-Draft curve is depicted in all the plots. The tool is also providing you a spreadsheet for further computations.

### Load conditions definition

In FreeCAD-Ship you can define as many weights and tanks as required. Then you can combine them alltogether in a load condition. At the time of defining weights, you can define:

 - Punctual masses, providing their masses.
 - Line elements, providing their linear densities (i.e. the area of the transversal section multiplied by the material density).
 - Surface elements, providing their surface densities (i.e. the width of the element multiplied by the material density).
 - Solid elements, providing their densities.

### Tank capacity curve

In FreeCAD-Ship you can easily plot the Filling volume-level ratio of any tank. Of course the tool is providing you a spreadsheet with the information about filling level percentage, filling level height and resulting volume.

### Static sink and trim

![Ship_SinkAndTrim Icon](freecad/ship/resources/icons/Ship_SinkAndTrim.svg)

Get a visual hint on the equilibrium draft and trim angle for a certain load condition. You can choose between the representation in the upright ship position, or setting the free-surface as the z=0 plane.

### GZ curve

The main transversal stability indicator, it is unsurprisingly required by the vast majority of the classification societies to certify a ship. This tool is computing that for you, providing a plot and the associated spreadsheet.
